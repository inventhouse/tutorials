# MintySynth By Example

*(TODO: finish adding control refs, double-check run-through)*

- Use the mixer to turn off the four parts (**|5+w1-w4 ↓**) to quiet the default tones; it’s good that the synth has some output by default, but I just turn that off and make it do what I want.
- Switch to live mode (**.1+.5**) and choose voices to be your palette for the programmed parts. (**|1-|4+w1**)
- Switch to programming part 1 (**.5+.1**), turn that part back up (**|5+w1 ↑**), and select one of your voice buttons (though you can go back and change the part’s voice later.)
- Hold button 1 and sequence the first measure of part 1.
- Now hold button 3, nudge each wheel and return it to position to sequence the same thing in.
- You can now similarly sequence measures 2 & 4 for an A-B-A-B structure or do different things for A-B-A-C  (of course, you can also program all different sequences, too.)
- Use mixer to turn part 1 down half way (more or less) and turn part 2 up
- Switch to programming part 2.
- Repeat with the other parts you want to program; I like to do a bassline in part 1, percussion(ish) in part 2, pads or melody in part 3, and leave part 4 for live mode.  
- The mixer is your friend; solo parts, mute others, “check in on” the whole, whatever helps you hear what you’re doing.
- If you want, you can “really” sequence part 4 or treat it like a rhythm track and just program which notes you want to sound.
- Switch to live mode and reprogram your bank of voices for more options.
- Jam!  Experiment!  Have fun!
- Don’t be shy with the mixer here either; build parts in, drop some drops, cut parts that are sounding repetitive for a while, keep things lively.
