The following are my (hopefully) clarified and generalized version of the rules.


Equipment
---------
Each player needs:
- A 3×4-square mini-board that can be joined with other boards on a long and short side.
- 2d4, 2d6, and 1d8 which must form a clear set, distinct from all other players.
    - Commonly, dice sets may only include one d4 and one d6; we can duplicate them with other dice as follows: roll the d4, d6, and d8, then "copy" the d4 and d6 scores to, say, the units and tens d10s (or other dice) respectively, and re-roll the actual dice.  Note: it is important to know the upper limit of each stand-in when adjusting dice below.


Setup
-----
- Each player rolls, but hides their dice from opponents.
- Each player announces their total score and all players (except highest scorer) adjust their own dice as they see fit to match the high score.
- Still in secret, players arrange their dice as they wish on their board.
- Players reveal and connect their boards to each other; players should know or agree in advance which edges will be joined.
    - Two boards are joined on a long edge to make a 4×6 rectangular board.
    - Three or more boards connect so the short edge of each joins the "outer" three squares of the long edge of the next forming a ring.  In a 4-player game this creates a neat, square, 7×7 board with one "missing" square in the middle; in all cases this center space is off-limits.  If the boards cannot all physically mate in this way, play ignores the "wedges" and works just as if adjoining boards really were connected.


Play
----
- Players take it in turn to choose and move a die.  Moves progress orthogonally the same number of spaces as marked on the die, though not necessarily in a straight line.
    - Moves can cross occupied spaces but may not revisit a space and must land on an empty space.
    - Dice cannot move diagonally, nor are diagonally situated dice affected by other dice.
- Any opposing dice orthogonally adjacent to the just-moved die are decremented by 1.
    - Any dice reduced to 0 are removed from the board.
- A player is eliminated from the game when they have only 1 die left.
- The last player with two or more dice remaining is the winner.
