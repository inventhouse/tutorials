# MintySynth Supplementary Docs

[MintySynth](https://mintysynth.com) is a remarkable little Arduino-based sequencer / synthesizer I picked up from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2648); it is a really well-done kit that packs a **LOT** of noisemaking capability into a very small and inexpensive package.

The [manual](https://mintysynth.com/MintySynth%20Software%20Manual%204.2.pdf) covers all the myriad thing it can do, but there were a couple things I wished I had - so I wrote them:

- [A Quick Reference card](./MintySynthMiniRef.pdf) - Once you've read the manual, this can help you find all the control combinations in one place.  It is organized into three panels, two that pack in the controls and one that explains the notation I devised.  There are two versions, one that shows the concepts in bold and the other highlighting the controls; use whichever is clearest to you.  It can be folded and kept in the tin, taped to the lid, or in a sleeve taped to the bottom.
- [An example workflow](./MintySynthByExample.md) - There are a lot of modes and options and whatnot, this is a walk-through showing one way they can fit together into a composing and playing workflow. **[Currently Work-In-Progress]**
