Using Knots You Already Know
============================

> This will focus on the overhand, half-hitch, and larks head; the simplest knots used even by people who don't know what they're called.  If you know other knots, keep using them and apply the detailed examination and experimentation I encourage here.


“Why do you carry rope?”
---------------------------
People are sometimes surprised that I have rope with me all the time; when I ask them why they don't, the two most common answers I get are:

- “I’m no good at knots”
    - You know more than you think
- “I wouldn’t know what to do with it”
    - If you have it, you'll find more uses for it (and hopefully the ideas here will help, too)

_(( maybe add some examples / teasers here? ))_

### Too much fancy-knot-focus, not enough rope-think
Being "good with knots" is really more about "being good with rope" (and making good use of the knots you know)

Many knot books and guides inadvertantly perpetuate this, especially with:

- The myth of "use the right knot"
    > Italian proverb: "the best is the enemy of the good"
    - Does the knot do the job?  Good.  Done.
    - Non-critical situations only! (Which is most of the time)

- Activity-specific categories - sailing, fishing, camping, etc
    - Knots are useful all the time, not just doing "outdoors-y" things.  (Also, some people might be more interested in outdoor activities if knots were less intimidating)


Study _Your_ Knots
------------------
Whatever knots you use, whenever you use them, pay attention to how you tie them, how they hold, and how they're working in each situation.
- Look at the way the rope crosses, lays, and pulls; where is the tension?  What if direction changes?  What about tugging or snagging?
- What keeps this knot together?
- What would make it change or fail?

Take a knot you're really familiar with and dissect it; try making different choices about which way the ropes cross, etc.
- A bow or shoelace knot has _many_ variations, get together with some friends, compare techniques, and examine the subtle differences.
- Notice that it's (usually) really two of the same knot (the overhand knot) one on top of the other. (The second is done with loops, but still)
- How many different configurations can you come up with?

Try knots in different situations and different knots in the same setting; make guesses about how different ties might work and test them.  Don’t be afraid of mistakes (in non-critical situations - which, again, is most of the time)


Some Basic Knot Types
---------------------
What are knots _for_?  Essentially, they make a rope _do_ something - what do you want the rope to do?  First we'll talk about some of the general things and how to do them with knots you probably already know (or slight variants of them.)

### Free-running loop
A loop that slides freely is really useful for closing down on something to grip or secure it; be careful with putting body parts in them, though.  The simplest running loop you may not have even thought of as a knot at all:

_(( Lark's head here ))_

The lark's head is also incredibly fast - double your rope over and pull the ends through and it's secure!

### Fixed loop
Sometimes you want a loop that _doesn't_ tighten; just take a loop of rope and tie a simple overhand knot:

_(( Overhand-on-bight ))_

_(( Fixed-to-running / tie off lark's head ))_

### Sliding knot

- Intro half-hitches

### Joining knot
- Simple overhand with two ends
- Water knot

### Stopper knot

### Systems of knots
    - Cinch


Some Examples
-------------
- Jacket sling
- Bag sling - thinking about rope-and-object working together

- Handle
- Adjustable length
- Hishi karada

- Dog leash
- Water bottle sling


"Magic String"
--------------
Friends dubbed the rope I carry "Ben's magic string", I hope you

- Paracord
    - ~550lb breaking strength, some stretch, kernmantle, many colors/patterns, super-popular lately, craft/hardware-store quality varies _wildly_
- Boot laces
    - Available everywhere, cut-and-finished
- Whatever
    - The rope you have with you beats the rope you don't

- Length - ~two arm-spans, I use 3m ~10'
- Cutting and burning
    - Knife vs. scissors
    - Brief plug for EMT shears
- Fold + knot to keep from tangling
    - Works with cables, too


Use Your Rope
-------------
- Carry rope - and use it!
    - The more you use it, the better you’ll get with it
- Don’t be afraid of mistakes - most situations are non-critical
    - _Do_ think about what might happen if your knots fail, though
- Study _your_ knots - the knots _you_ tie
- Tie and re-tie, try new ways based on your observations
    - What could be better? - hard to tie, hard to untie, slips or loosens, I wish...

- Eventually learn others, but variations of the overhand will go surprisingly far
    - Seeing the subtleties will help a _lot_ learning new knots

Throughout this tutorial I've deliberately avoided knot jargon, and I won't link any knot guides here at the end; spend some time really getting to know _your_ knots, and then check out my follow-up guide to learning new ones.
