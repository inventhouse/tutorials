Using Knots You Already Know
============================

“Why don’t you carry rope?”
---------------------------
- “I’m no good at knots”
- “I wouldn’t know what to do with it”
- Too much knot-focus, not enough rope-think
- This talk should teach as _few_ knots as possible, use minimal knot jargon


Magic String
------------
- Boot laces, paracord, whatever
- Brief intro to paracord
    - ~550lb breaking strength, some stretch, many colors/patterns, super-popular lately, craft/hardware-store quality varies _wildly_
- Length - 6'-12', I use 3m ~10'
- Cutting and burning
    - Knife vs. scissors
    - Brief plug for EMT shears
- Coiling/folding + knot
    - Works with cables, too


Study Your Knots
----------------
- Don’t be afraid of mistakes (in non-critical situations - which is most of the time)
- Look closely at your knots
    - Look at the way the rope lays and pulls - where is the tension?  what if it changes?  tugs?
    - What keeps this knot together?  
    - What would make it change or fail?
- *Everyone tie a bow*, look closer, take it apart - right-over-left?  square or granny? notice that it's really two overhand knots (second is done with loops, but still); how many different configurations can you tie?


Some Basic Knot Types
---------------------
- Running loop
    - Lark's head
    - Don't put body parts in running loops!
- Fixed loop
    - Overhand-on-bight
    - Fixed-to-running
- Sliding knot
    - Intro half-hitches
- Stopper knot
- Systems of knots
    - Cinch


Some examples
- Jacket sling
- Bag sling - thinking about rope-and-object working together
- Handle
- Adjustable length
- Karada

- Dog leash
- Water bottle sling


Use Your Rope
-------------
- Carry rope - and use it!
    - The more you use it, the better you’ll get with it
- Don’t be afraid of mistakes - most situations are non-critical
    - _Do_ think about what might happen if your knots fail, though
- Study _your_ knots - the knots _you_ tie
- Tie and re-tie, try new ways based on your observations
    - What could be better? - hard to tie, hard to untie, slips or loosens, I wish...
    - Eventually learn others, but variations of the overhand will go surprisingly far
