The Mighty Shell
================

- Unix has evolved with many contributions from countless people across several variations over decades; there are some common patterns that have emerged but not much is truly universal across all versions, shells, or commands.
    - I'll try to talk about the most common expected practices and use the word "should", but be aware that there are going to be oddball cases for pretty much everything.

- What is "the shell"
    - _interchangable_
    - interpreter
    - dispatcher
    - "environment" - rc files
    - scripting language (but kinda terrible)
    - accessories like prompt, aliases

- Commands
    - command, options, arguments
        - short vs. long options
        - options that take arguments
        - dash for stdin/out
        - dash-dash for end-of-options
