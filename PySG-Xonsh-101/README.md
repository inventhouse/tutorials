Xonsh 101
=========
"If you know Python and you use Bash ever, you already know why you want more Python in your shell." - [Xonsh quickstart]

Shell
-----
- Run commands - direct invocation, "builtins", and transparent fallback "path"
    - arguments, flags, subcommands, and other "command line interface"
- Pipelines
- Scripting

- [Talks & articles](https://xon.sh/talks_and_articles.html)
    - Check out the PyCon talk for a whirlwind tour; somewhat dated, xonsh has improved significantly since then, but still impressive and entertaining
- [Xonsh installation](https://xon.sh/#installation)
    - Lots of ways to install, pick your poison `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- [Xonsh quickstart](https://github.com/ninjaaron/xonsh-quickstart#basic-configuration-etc)
    - _Really_ good tutorial, maybe better than the official one
    - While you're in the neighborhood, this is also really good:
        - [Replacing Bash Scripting with Python](https://github.com/ninjaaron/replacing-bash-scripting-with-python)
- [Xonsh cheatsheet](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/wiki/Cheatsheet)
    - Keep this handy when you're learning the different modes / substitutions / extensions to navigate the choppy waters where Python and Shell mix
- [Official tutorial](https://xon.sh/tutorial.html)
    - Definitely read this and refer to it, but I've found the previous two links more usful "in the moment"
- [Home page](https://xon.sh/)
    - Lots more documentation here, keep diging as you get more familiar or you find you have specific needs
- [Source code](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh)
    - The great thing about a shell written in the language it's based on is that you can read the code to understand how it really works - and contribute back!

Other interesting shells

    - Another Python shell, _very_ interesting pipelining system
- [Nushell](http://www.jonathanturner.org/2019/08/introducing-nushell.html)
    - _Fascinating_ "structured data"-based shell, apparently at least in part inspired by...
- [Powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)
    - I think I should learn more about this
