Xonsh 101
=========

Introduction
------------
"If you know Python and you use Bash ever, you already know why you want more Python in your shell." - Aaron Christianson (ninjaaron)

### Shell is great
- Run commands - direct invocation, "builtins", and transparent fallback "path"
    - arguments, flags, subcommands, and other "command line interface"
- Pipelines - link small commands together to do remarkable things
- Customization - helpful prompt, aliases, configurable path
- Scripting

### Shell is terrible
- Everything is strings
- Often parsed badly; problems _everywhere_
    - `"Quotes" won't save you! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è` is a valid filename
        - "But that's an edge-case" - our jobs would be __*SO*__ easy if we didn't have to deal with edge-cases!
        - Weird filenames exist, like `/bin/[` - see if you can spot that later in this section
- Lots of commands are arcane (and archaic)
- Syntax is insane; I wrote this, don't be like me:
```bash
: ${GetChunkDelim:="###"}
if [ "$1" == "-h" -o "$1" == "--help" -o -z "$1" -o -z "$2" ]; then
  cat <<USAGE
usage:...
USAGE
  exit 0
fi
cat "$1" | sed -e"1,/^${GetChunkDelim}[ 	][ 	]*$2/ d" -e"/^${GetChunkDelim}/,$ d"
```

### Python is great
- Real data structures
- Real control structures
- Lots of powerful libraries
...but not good at shell things (from the `subprocess` docs):
```python
# $ dmesg | grep hda
p1 = Popen(["dmesg"], stdout=PIPE)
p2 = Popen(["grep", "hda"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
p1.stdout.close()  # Allow p1 to receive a SIGPIPE if p2 exits.
output = p2.communicate()[0]
```

### Why not both?
Imagine an environment with...
- Simple, direct, command invocation, with all your old shell friends
- Pipes, redirection, job control
- Full Python interpreter
- Fancy prompts, completions, extensions
- True multi-line editing

### Xonsh
- Pronounced like 'K'; spelled with an 'X' 'cos Xes are cool
- Brings together Python and shell (aka "subprocess mode")
- With ways to work with both and move data between the two
- Plus loads of modern terminal bells & whistles, customizability, etc.

### What's it like?
- Mostly "just works" - type shell commands and pipelines or python at any prompt anytime
- Best of both worlds: great shell features, and _WAY_ better than the standard python interpreter
- Configuration takes some learning and experimentation
- Interaction between shell and python _definitely_ takes some learning and experimentation, just starting to get my "sea-legs"
- Barely scratched the surface, ask me again in a year

### Brief tour
- Per-line "duck typing" - if it parses like Python... (otherwise treat it as shell)
- Various extra syntax to force or mix modes:
    - `@()` for python, `$()`, `!()`, `$[]`, `![]` for shell
- `$VAR` for global environment variables, accessible from either shell or python
    - Python types get `str`-ified in subprocess mode
    - Special rules to split / join `$PATH`-like vars
- `aliases` is a dict(ish) and can map to strings, lists, or callables
    - powerful, but a bit tricky
- "glob expressions", using backticks, are super-cool; "p-strings" (and p-globs) produce [`Path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use) objects
- My [.xonshrc](https://github.com/inventhouse/BenBin/blob/master/xonshrc)
- My [xonsh_aliases.xsh](https://github.com/inventhouse/BenBin/blob/master/xonsh_aliases.xsh)

### Examples

### Gotchas
- Backticks are different than sh/bash, use `$()`
- Backslashes don't work for character escaping in shell, use quotes
- Must use `env` for setting "temporary" env vars
- To use pipes in aliases wrap in callable
- _Not_ recommended as `$SHELL` - set in terminal apps instead
- Anaconda, standard virtualenv tools, and similar "source"-based things expect specific mainstream shells; use `vox` / `autovox`, for example
- Still kinda new; some rough spots, documentation is thin in places - contribute!

### Join me!
- Radically different and, I think, _MUCH_ better
- Build deeper familiarity with Python instead of piles of commands that aren't very good for other larger things
- Environment is written in Python, fix, change, document, and contribute to it
- Grow your ideas from hacks into proper tools
